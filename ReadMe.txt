1. Add all desired shortcuts to the same folder that contains "OpenShortcuts.bat".

2. Copy the shortcut names into shortcuts.txt (one shortcut per line).

3. Create a shortcut of "OpenShortcuts.bat" and move it to "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\".

4. Customize! I recomend renaming the shortcut in the start menu to something like "aUnityWorkspace". This way autocompletion will easily find what you want and rarely confuse it with other aplications as in this case "Unity Hub" or other unity shortcuts that may exist.

5. PROFIT.
